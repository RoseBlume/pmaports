# We are supposed to use "asurada" board here, but asurada dts does
# not include asurada compatible which results in loading a wrong
# dtb. "mt8192" board may result in including dtbs that are for
# mt8192 but not related to Chrome OS devices which would increase
# image size. This doesn't happen for us because we provide only 
# dtbs from deviceinfo_dtb variable and nothing more, so use "mt8192"
# board here.
